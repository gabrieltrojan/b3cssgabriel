      <h2>The proboscis Monkey</h2>
      <p>or long-nosed monkey, known as the bekantan in Indonesia, is an arboreal Old World monkey with an unusually large nose, a reddish-brown skin color and a long tail. It is endemic to the southeast Asian island of Borneo and is found mostly in mangrove forests and on the coastal areas of the island.</p>

        <h2>Proboscis Monkeys</h2>
        <p>The primate world contains some pretty odd specimens, but perhaps none more strange-looking than the Proboscis monkeys. </p>
		<p>Proboscis means nose, which explains their name, as the noses on the males of this species are clownishly large. </p>
		<p>These unique monkeys inhabit the island of Borneo in southern Asia and nowhere else on the planet. </p>
		<p>Their over-sized noses allow the male Proboscis monkeys to make loud bellowing noises to warn of predators or to attract mates. </p>
		<p>The other notable feature of these monkeys is there protruding stomachs, which allow them to digest their primary food of unripe fruits. </p>
		<p>Proboscis monkeys can most often be found in the trees of swamps, or sometimes swimming across the rivers of the jungle. </p>
		<p>Females become sexually mature at 5 years old. </p>
		<p>They are known to leap from high branches and into water. </p>
		<p>Males weigh on average 20kg, whereas females weigh roughly half as much as the males. </p>
		<p>Many of the monkey’s toes are webbed, but not all of them. </p>

      <p>Proboscis monkeys generally live in groups composed of one adult male, some adult females and their offspring. All-male groups may also exist. Some individuals are solitary, mostly males. Monkey groups live in overlapping home ranges, with little territoriality, in a fission-fusion society, with groups gathering at sleeping sites as night falls. There exist bands which arise when groups come together and slip apart yet sometimes groups may join to mate and groom.</p>

      <p>Groups gather during the day and travel together, but individuals only groom and play with those in their own group. One-male groups consist of 9–19 individuals, while bands can consist of as many as 60 individuals. One-male groups typically consist of three to 12 individuals, but can contain more. Serious aggression is uncommon among the monkeys but minor aggression does occur. Overall, members of the same bands are fairly tolerant of each other. </p>

      <p>A linear dominance hierarchy exists between females. Males of one-male groups can stay in their groups for six to eight years. Replacements in the resident males appear to occur without serious aggression. Upon reaching adulthood, males leave their natal groups and join all-male groups. Females also sometimes leave their natal groups, perhaps to avoid infanticide or inbreeding, reduce competition for food, or elevation of their social status.</p>


      <p>Females become sexually mature at the age of five years. They experience sexual swelling, which involves the genitals becoming pink or reddened. At one site, matings largely take place between February and November, while births occur between March and May. Copulations tend to last for half a minute. The male will grab the female by the ankles or torso and mount her from behind. Both sexes will encourage mating, but they are not always successful. </p>

      <p>When soliciting, both sexes will make pouted faces. In addition, males will sometimes vocalize and females will present their backsides and shake their head from side to side. Mating pairs are sometimes harassed by subadults. Proboscis monkeys may also engage in mounting with no reproductive purpose, such as playful and same-sex mounting, and females will attempt to initiate copulation even after they have conceived. </p>

      <p>Gestation usually last 166–200 days or slightly more. Females tend to give birth at night or in the early morning. The mothers then eat the placenta and lick their infants clean. The young begin to eat solid foods at six weeks and are weaned at seven months old. The nose of a young male grows slowly until reaching adulthood. The mother will allow other members of her group to hold her infant. When a resident male in a one-male group is replaced, the infants are at risk of infanticide.

      <p>Proboscis monkeys are known to make various vocalizations. When communicating the status of group, males will emit honks. They have a special honk emitted towards infants, which is also used for reassurance. Males will also produce alarm calls to signal danger. Both sexes give threat calls, but each are different. In addition, females and immature individuals will emit so-called "female calls" when angry. Honks, roars and snarls are made during low-intensity agonistic encounters. Nonvocal displays include leaping-branch shaking, bare-teeth open mouth threats and erection in males, made in the same situations.</p>
