      <p>This is a site about apes and gorillas. In fact it's a site about primates and CSS. If you had enough primates, all working together, they would produce pretty good style sheets. Maybe.</p>

  <section class="main-content">
    <p>When Jane Goodall first witnessed Gombe chimpanzee David Greybeard fishing for termites by manipulating blades of grass in 1960, the line between humans and other animals suddenly became blurry. Tool use was no longer uniquely human, leading Dr. Louis Leakey, Jane’s mentor, to famously say, “Now we must redefine tool, redefine man, or accept chimpanzees as human.”  </p>

    <p>We know that chimpanzees are our closest cousins in the animal kingdom, sharing 98.6% of our DNA. Chimpanzees are also known to exhibit remarkably human-like behaviors, such as grieving over the loss of a loved one, generating strategies to thrive in social groups, and even learning sign language.  </p>

    <p>But what allows us to share these things in common? Is it our brain structure, our shared genetic similarities, or our cultures? Turns out, it’s a mix of many things! </p>


    <p>To start, it’s important to understand the chimpanzee “fission-fusion” social system. In this system, there are communities of up to 100 individuals that occasionally come together to eat, socialize, and mate, but spend most of their time in tighter sub-groups.  Early human communities are thought to have lived in similar groups</p>

    <p>Strong alliances, bonds, and intrasexual dominance hierarchies between members make up most of the social dynamics in chimpanzee groups. Through these hierarchies, members of the same sex compete for access to resources such reproductive mates or food, resulting in alpha males and alpha females. Studies of human culture lead us to believe that we too operate with intrasexual hierarchies – just think about the famous myths in which men compete for the heart of a woman to become king!  </p>

    <p>Although males are dominant overall in chimpanzee groups, the most important relationships are between mothers and their dependent offspring, which we know largely thanks to studies initiated by Jane in the early 1960s. Chimpanzees learn essential life skills from their mothers, including how to pick up on emotional cues, be a good leader, and demonstrate compassion.

    <p>Flo and Gremlin, for example, are two popular and outstanding chimpanzee mothers from Gombe. Gremlin persevered through the hard task of raising twins in the wild, and two of Flo’s sons grew up to become alpha males. Together, they showcase the importance of a strong mother-infant relationship – something humans need as well. </p>

        <img src="images/th/th-image-01.jpg" alt="">
        <p>The mountain gorilla (Gorilla beringei beringei) is one of the two subspecies of the eastern gorilla. There are two populations: One is found in the Virunga volcanic mountains of Central Africa, within three National Parks: Mgahinga, in south-west Uganda; Volcanoes, in north-west Rwanda; and Virunga, in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The mountain gorilla is listed as endangered by the IUCN as of 2018.</p>

        <h3>What's the point of saving endangered species?</h3>
        <img src="images/th/th-image-03.jpg" alt="">
        <p>In 1981, mountain gorillas were at rock-bottom. Confined to a small mountain range in central Africa, with humans encroaching on their habitat bringing poaching and civil war, their population was estimated at just 254. They would all have fitted into a single Boeing 747. Today things look a little better. A survey in 2012 reported that the population was up to 880. That is a big improvement, but it's still only two Boeing 747s of mountain gorillas. They remain critically endangered.</p>

        <h3>Mgahinga Gorilla National Park</h3>
        <img src="images/th/th-image-04.jpg" alt="">
        <p>The park is located about 15 km south of Kisoro, in the district of the same name, in Bufumbira county, and covers the Ugandan part of the Virunga mountain range. Covering an area of 33.7 km2, it is the newest and smallest Ugandan national park and one of only two, along with the Impenetrable Forest of Bwindi, to house mountain gorillas in the country. Contiguous to the Virunga National Park in the Democratic Republic of Congo and to the Volcanoes National Park in Rwanda, it forms with them a protected area of 434 km2 in total.</p>

        <img src="images/th/th-image-05.jpg" alt="">
        <p>The western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) is one of two subspecies of the western gorilla (Gorilla gorilla) that lives in montane, primary and secondary forests and lowland swamps in central Africa in Angola, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Republic of the Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea and Gabon. It is the nominate subspecies of the western gorilla, and the smallest of the four gorilla subspecies.</p>

        <img src="images/th/th-image-06.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Western gorillas are generally lighter colored than eastern gorillas. Western lowland gorillas have black, dark grey or dark brown-grey fur with a brownish forehead. Measurements of wild individuals show that mature males average 1.55 metres (5 ft 1 in) in height, while mature females average 1.35 metres (4 ft 5 in). Weights of wild individuals have been rarely taken but captive western gorillas average 157 kg (346 lb) in males and 80 kg (176 lb) in females. The average weight of wild male western lowland gorillas is 146 kg.</p>

        <img src="images/th/th-image-07.jpg" alt="">
        <p>The clash between these two heavyweights of nature was immortalized by a visitor to the Paignton zoo in Devon, England. The two western lowland gorillas clashed in a real boxing fight, exchanging heavy blows before the former accepted his "condition." Western lowland gorillas are the most common gorilla species encountered in zoos, although they are listed by endangered species as, unfortunately, all gorillas.</p>
