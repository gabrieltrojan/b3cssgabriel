          <img src="images/th/th-image-01.jpg" alt="">
          <p>The mountain gorilla (Gorilla beringei beringei) is one of the two subspecies of the eastern gorilla. There are two populations: One is found in the Virunga volcanic mountains of Central Africa, within three National Parks: Mgahinga, in south-west Uganda; Volcanoes, in north-west Rwanda; and Virunga, in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The mountain gorilla is listed as endangered by the IUCN as of 2018.</p>

          <h3>What's the point of saving endangered species?</h3>
          <img src="images/th/th-image-03.jpg" alt="">
          <p>In 1981, mountain gorillas were at rock-bottom. Confined to a small mountain range in central Africa, with humans encroaching on their habitat bringing poaching and civil war, their population was estimated at just 254. They would all have fitted into a single Boeing 747. Today things look a little better. A survey in 2012 reported that the population was up to 880. That is a big improvement, but it's still only two Boeing 747s of mountain gorillas. They remain critically endangered.</p>

          <img src="images/th/th-image-04.jpg" alt="">
          <p>The park is located about 15 km south of Kisoro, in the district of the same name, in Bufumbira county, and covers the Ugandan part of the Virunga mountain range. Covering an area of 33.7 km2, it is the newest and smallest Ugandan national park and one of only two, along with the Impenetrable Forest of Bwindi, to house mountain gorillas in the country. Contiguous to the Virunga National Park in the Democratic Republic of Congo and to the Volcanoes National Park in Rwanda, it forms with them a protected area of 434 km2 in total.</p>

          <img src="images/th/th-image-05.jpg" alt="">
          <p>The western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) is one of two subspecies of the western gorilla (Gorilla gorilla) that lives in montane, primary and secondary forests and lowland swamps in central Africa in Angola, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Republic of the Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea and Gabon. It is the nominate subspecies of the western gorilla, and the smallest of the four gorilla subspecies.</p>

          <img src="images/th/th-image-06.jpg" alt="">
          <p>Western gorillas are generally lighter colored than eastern gorillas. Western lowland gorillas have black, dark grey or dark brown-grey fur with a brownish forehead. Measurements of wild individuals show that mature males average 1.55 metres (5 ft 1 in) in height, while mature females average 1.35 metres (4 ft 5 in). Weights of wild individuals have been rarely taken but captive western gorillas average 157 kg (346 lb) in males and 80 kg (176 lb) in females. The average weight of wild male western lowland gorillas is 146 kg.</p>

          <img src="images/th/th-image-07.jpg" alt="">
          <p>The clash between these two heavyweights of nature was immortalized by a visitor to the Paignton zoo in Devon, England. The two western lowland gorillas clashed in a real boxing fight, exchanging heavy blows before the former accepted his "condition." Western lowland gorillas are the most common gorilla species encountered in zoos, although they are listed by endangered species as, unfortunately, all gorillas.</p>

          <p>The chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), also known as the common chimpanzee, robust chimpanzee, or simply "chimp", is a species of great ape native to the forests and savannahs of tropical Africa. It has four confirmed subspecies and a fifth proposed subspecies. The chimpanzee and the closely related bonobo (sometimes called the "pygmy chimpanzee") are classified in the genus Pan. Evidence from fossils and DNA sequencing shows that Pan is a sister taxon to the human lineage and is humans' closest living relative.</p>

          <img src="images/th/th-image-11.jpg" alt="">
          <p>Jack Ma Quotes about business. "If you put bananas and money in front of monkeys, monkeys will choose bananas because monkeys do not know that money can buy a lot of bananas. In reality, if you offer a job and business to people, they would choose job because most people do not know that business can bring more money than wages. Profit is better than wages, for wages can make you a living but profits can bring you a fortune."</p>

          <p>The Bornean orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus) is a species of orangutan native to the island of Borneo. Together with the Sumatran orangutan and Tapanuli orangutan, it belongs to the only genus of great apes native to Asia. Like the other great apes, orangutans are highly intelligent, displaying tool use and distinct cultural patterns in the wild. Orangutans share approximately 97% of their DNA with humans.</p>

          <p>The Sumatran orangutans are a separate species. There are approximately 14,000 in the wild. At the pet black market, the baby orangutan is expensive. As her mother is very protective, she must be killed to take her child away from her. Males weigh almost 90 kg, making the orangutan the largest tree animal in the world.</p>
